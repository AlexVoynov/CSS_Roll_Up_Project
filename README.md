###This is a classroom activity demonstrating how collapsible bookmarks work.
###[Click here to see the implementation of the task](https://alexvoynov.github.io/CSS_Roll_Up_Task/)
###This is an assignment that was done individually during the SDA Academy training. The task was to create bookmarks that expand the content. The problems that had to be solved were the alignment of the borders of all images and fields, the correct placement of unfolding content. This project did not aim to create complete responsiveness.
